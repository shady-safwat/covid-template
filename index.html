                                        On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the 
                                        disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.

                                        People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or

                                        and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans

                                        Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is 
                                        associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, 
                                        fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                                        Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the

                                        Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as 
                                        canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect 
                                        animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to

                                        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that 
                                        originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and

                                        This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were 
                                        linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s 
                                        important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are
                                        highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                                        It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some 
                                        other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that 
                                        does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this

                                        Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory 
                                        droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with 
                                        food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and 
                                        water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after 
                                        blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                        It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the 
                                        virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not 
                                        thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                        In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very 
                                        low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or
                                        weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                        The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients 
                                        may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These 
                                        symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t 
                                        develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the 
                                        disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 
                                        becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying 
                                        medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to 
                                        develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical 
                                        attention.

                                        may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.

                                        This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot 
                                        of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working 
                                        age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school 
                                        may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local 
                                        media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use 
                                        alternative childcare arrangements, if needed
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk 
                                        with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up 
                                        with their schoolwork.

                                        Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed 
                                        to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

                                        Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory 
                                        droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with 
                                        food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and 
                                        water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after 
                                        blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                        It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the 
                                        virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not 
                                        thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                        In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very 
                                        low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or 
                                        weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                        To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could 
                                        be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads 
                                        primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through 
                                        droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently
                                        with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact 
                                        with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

                                        Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a 
                                        higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.

                                        However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is 
                                        because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.

                                        No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza 
                                        type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

                                        The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to 
                                        develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.

                                    <p>
                                        Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory 
                                        illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
